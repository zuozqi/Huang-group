 abstract = {An equation of state for normal liquid 3He has been constructed in the form of Helmholtz free energy as a function of independent parameters - temperature, and density. The equation was fitted simultaneously to the collected experimental p-ρ-T, specific heat, sound velocity, isobaric expansion coefficient and isothermal compressibility coefficient from the world's literature to accuracies comparable with reasonable experimental errors in the measured quantities. Extensive comparisons between the equation of state and experimental data have been made by a set of deviation plots. The state equation is valid in the region for temperatures from 0.1 K to Tc = 3.3157 K, and for pressures from vapor pressures to melting pressures. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2006.},
