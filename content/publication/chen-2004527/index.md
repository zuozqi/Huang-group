abstract: The computation with the theory of modified Brayton Cycle indicates that
  higher cooling power and coefficient of performance for a pulse tube refrigerator
  can be achieved with He-H2 mixture as working gas than those with pure He in the
  temperature region of 30 K. In addition, it is found that Er3Ni, a regenerative
  material, is able to absorb H2 and produces Er3NiHx. The computation presents that
  the regenerative performance of Er3NiHx is better than that of Er3Ni due to its
  higher volume specific heat. Experimental results show that the pulse tube refrigeration
  performance in 30 K temperature region is enhanced greatly with He-H2 mixture and
  Er3NiH x packing.
