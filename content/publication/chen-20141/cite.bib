 abstract = {Three-dimensional numerical simulation on the evaporative surface of the micro wick structures in heat pipes was conducted using interfacial tension theory and surface discrete method. The micro menisci caused by wetting were discretized with triangle-based mesh. Following the principle of minimizing free energy, the thermodynamic equilibrium status was then determined by moving mesh nodes. The behaviors of capillary force, total evaporation area, and thin-film area, etc. were studied systematically with different geometric parameters and contact angles. © All Rights Reserved.},
