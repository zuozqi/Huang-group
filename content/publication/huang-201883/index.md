abstract: Controlling the pressure of a propellant tank while minimizing the propellant
  mass loss is the primary technical demand of cryogen storage missions in the reduced
  gravity environment in space. Thermodynamic vent system (TVS) has been considered
  as a potential solution for this issue. Before conducting studies on TVS-equipped
  cryogen storage technology in space and on the ground, a TVS unit at room temperature
  with refrigerant R141b as the substituting phase-changing fluid was designed and
  tested. The performance of the TVS was evaluated at different combinations of the
  operation parameters including the fill level (35%, 50%, 65%), heat load (74.7 W,
  108.8 W, 148.4 W), and control strategies. Mass loss, which is an unavoidable result
  of tank pressure control, was quantitatively compared between the TVS method and
  the direct gas vent method over a given period of time. Taking the heat load of
  74.7 W as an example, the results showed that the mass loss can be reduced by as
  much as 79.3%. Assuming the vented stream contains 40% mass fraction of liquid if
  vented directly at zero-gravity, TVS can not only control the tank pressure within
  a designated range but also significantly help to reduce the mass loss. © 2018 Elsevier
