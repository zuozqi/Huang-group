 abstract = {A novel gas-phase inlet configuration in the natural circulation system instead of the liquid-phase inlet is introduced to cool down a cryogenic pump system from room temperature to cryogenic temperatures, effectively. The experimental apparatus is illustrated and test process is described. Heat transfer and pressure drop data during the cool-down process are recorded and portrayed. By contrast with liquid-phase inlet configuration, experimental results demonstrate that the natural circulation with the gas-phase inlet configuration is an easier and more controllable way to cool down the pump system and maintain it at cryogenic temperatures. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.
