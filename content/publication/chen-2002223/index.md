abstract: Frequency matching is of great importance to a thermoacoustically driven
  pulse tube refrigeration system. To compute the resonance frequency of thermoacoustic
  engines, the fluid impedance method is introduced. The calculations of the thermoacoustic
  engines with different arrangements of buffer have been carried out. The influence
  of the buffer arrangements and the volume on the resonance frequency as well as
  the acoustic power of thermoacoustic engines is also discussed. Â© 2002 Elsevier
