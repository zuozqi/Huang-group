 abstract = {A new form of a fluid state equation, based on a conceptual extrapolation from the Debye equation for the specific heat of solid materials is described. The Debye characteristic temperature, Θ, which is nominally a constant for solids, becomes a function of the fluid density ρ. Further assuming yields the conventional fluid virial equation in the high-T and low-ρ limits for a monatomic fluid. Additional terms must be added to describe (a) the compressibility of the dense subcooled fluid and (b) properties in the near-critical range. Discussion of the Gruneisen parameter and other factors is included. This Debye fluid theory was used as a state equation for 3He, continuous from 0.005 K to above room temperature. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},
