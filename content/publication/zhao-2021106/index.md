abstract: Throttling is widely used in refrigeration, and is also involved in cryogenic
  liquefaction cycles such as Linde cycle, Claude cycle, J-T helium refrigeration
  cycle, and cryogenic propellant thermodynamic vent systems. In order to reveal the
  particularity of throttling effect of cryogenic fluids compared to ambient temperature
  gases and refrigerants, an experimental setup was designed and established to visualize
  two-phase cryogenic fluid throttling process. Taking a Laval nozzle as the testing
  element, the effects of inlet subcooling and pressure on throttling behavior of
  liquid nitrogen were investigated. The study showed that at given certain inlet
  pressure, the temperature drop and gas mass fraction increase with the inlet subcooling
  degree; at given certain inlet subcooling, the temperature drop and gas mass fraction
  increase with inlet pressure; higher inlet pressure and lower subcooling lead to
  lower refrigerating capacity. © 2021, Editorial Board of CIESC Journal. All right
