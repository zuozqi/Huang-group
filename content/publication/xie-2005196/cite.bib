 abstract = {A series of experiments were carried out to investigate cryogenic liquid transfer performance by self-pressurization method for liquid oxygen tank. The working fluid is nitrogen and the pressurizing gas is nitrogen including a small fraction of carbon dioxide, respectively. By varying the content of CO2 in the pressurizing gas, liquid oxygen gasifying pressurization mode and abundant oxygen pressurization mode are simulated. Besides, an experiment of CO2 crystallization in liquid nitrogen is also conducted. The experiments show that the modes of simulation test are feasible. The investigation provides a reference for further study.},
