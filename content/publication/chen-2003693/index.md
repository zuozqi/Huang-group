abstract: A novel gas-phase inlet configuration in the natural circulation system
  instead of the liquid-phase inlet is introduced to cool down a cryogenic pump system
  from room temperature to cryogenic temperatures, effectively. The experimental apparatus
  is illustrated and test process is described. Heat transfer and pressure drop data
  during the cool-down process are recorded and portrayed. By contrast with liquid-phase
  inlet configuration, experimental results demonstrate that the natural circulation
  with the gas-phase inlet configuration is an easier and more controllable way to
  cool down the pump system and maintain it at cryogenic temperatures. Â© 2003 Elsevier
