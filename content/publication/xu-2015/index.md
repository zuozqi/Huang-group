abstract: The cryogenic target is an important target type to achieve high inertial
  confinement fusion energy gain. The cooling arm connected the cool source to the
  aluminum sleeve is an important part of the cryogenic target, which is used to obtain
  accurate temperature field for the deuterium-tritium ice pellet, and uniformly clamp
  the aluminum sleeve. First the thermal conductivity of silicon material was measured,
  and the experiment shows that the silicon material has excellent thermal conductivity
  under the cryogenic temperature. Then the influences of structural parameters of
  the silicon cooling arm on the temperature field were analyzed. The impacts of different
  crystal orientation silicon cooling arm were studied, and the (111)silicon was chosen
  to fabricate cooling arm for its unique circumferentially uniform clamping force.
  The analyses of the clamping force, resonance frequency and the thermal-structure
  coupling analysis of the cooling arm were given. After that, the structure design
  of the cooling arm with two-level branch structure and 16 clamping fingers was proposed.
  Then the process of the cooling arm was designed based on MEMS technology and the
  prototype of cooling arm was realized. The vertical sidewall and mechanical properties
  of the cooling arm were measured. Finally the assembly sample of cooling arm with
  an aluminum sleeve was given, which indicated that the cooling arm can be achieved
  on clamping the sleeve. Â©, 2015, Editorial Office of High Power Laser and Particle
