abstract: Nonsegmented equations for melting pressure and density at temperatures
  from 0.001Kto30K have been developed to fit the reference data. The maximum and
  average deviations between the melting pressure equation and the totaling 298 reference
  data are 2.17% and 0.218%, respectively. For the density equations, the average
  deviations are 0.236% for the liquid side and 0.218% for the solid side. Both the
  melting pressure curve and melting density curves predicted by the submitted equations
  approach their minimums at about 0.315K. Â© 2005 The American Physical Society.
