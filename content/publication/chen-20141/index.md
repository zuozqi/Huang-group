abstract: Three-dimensional numerical simulation on the evaporative surface of the
  micro wick structures in heat pipes was conducted using interfacial tension theory
  and surface discrete method. The micro menisci caused by wetting were discretized
  with triangle-based mesh. Following the principle of minimizing free energy, the
  thermodynamic equilibrium status was then determined by moving mesh nodes. The behaviors
  of capillary force, total evaporation area, and thin-film area, etc. were studied
  systematically with different geometric parameters and contact angles. Â© All Rights
