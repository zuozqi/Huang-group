 abstract = {On the basis of the equation of state and the phase equilibrium equations of helium-3 ( 3He), a computer program for calculating the thermodynamic properties of 3He has been created. With this program, many iso-property tables were prepared for generating p-h and T-s diagrams of 3He over the range of temperature from 0.2K to 300 K and pressures up to 300MPa. Compared with the previous diagrams plotted with interpolated experimental data sets, the new ones are more thermodynamically consistent and cover a broader temperature and pressure range. The estimated overall random errors of the diagrams are within 2%. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.},
