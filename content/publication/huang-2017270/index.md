abstract: A numerical model based on an analytical lumped vapor assumption was proposed
  for highly efficient simulation of transient performances of heat pipes. The wick
  is modeled as fully thawed porous medium in which both the Darcian and non-Darcian
  effects are considered. The evaporation and condensation rates of the working substance
  are calculated locally as a function of not only the liquid–vapor interface temperature
  but also the vapor state properties by the kinetic theory. The coupled equations
  for liquid flow and heat conduction in/between components of the heat pipe are solved
  by a thermal lattice Boltzmann algorithm. Validation of the model is conducted by
  reproducing representative cases from the literature and then comparing the present
  results with their experimental and theoretical data. It turns out that both the
  transient temperature variation and the steady-state temperature and pressure profiles
  are in accordance with the literature results. The vapor velocity profile inferred
  from the evaporation rates is also found to be sufficiently accurate, which even
  gives a more reasonable estimate than the reference in comparison. In order to further
  improve the simulation efficiency of the code, non-uniform lattice and parallel
  algorithm are incorporated, based upon which the lumped vapor model achieves a speed
  over 50 times faster than the plain model with complete vapor consideration. The
  present model could serve as an efficient tool for quick evaluation of transient
  heat pipe behaviors and for assisting parametric studies of heat pipes. © 2016 Elsevier
