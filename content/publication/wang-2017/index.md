abstract: Thermodynamic vent system (TVS) is employed for pressure control of propellant
  tanks at zero gravity. An analytical lumped parameter model is developed to predict
  pressure variation in an 18.09 m3 liquid hydrogen tank equipped with TVS. Mathematical
  simulations are carried out assuming tank is filled up to 75% volume (liquid mass
  equals to 945 kg) and is subjected to heat flux of 0.76 W/m2. Tank pressure controls
  at 165.5-172.4, 165.5-179.3 and 165.5-182.2 kPa are compared with reference to number
  of vent cycles, vent duration per cycle and loss of hydrogen. Analysis results indicate
  that the number of vent cycles significantly decreases from 62 to 21 when tank pressure
  control increases from 6.9 to 20.4 kPa. Also, duration of vent cycle increases from
  63 to 152 and cycle duration decreases from 3920 to 3200 s. Further, the analysis
  result suggests that LH2 evaporation loss per day decreases from 0.17 to 0.14%.
  Based on the results of analysis, TVS is found effective in controlling the propellant
  tank pressure in zero gravity. Â© Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.
