abstract: The thermal conductivity behavior of liquid helium-3 is investigated upon
  temperature and pressure variation. Taking into account the singularity in the vicinity
  of the critical point, equations of thermal conductivity of 3He (0.003~3.3157 K)
  on its saturation curve and in the compressed liquid region at pressures up to 20
  MPa are proposed. The relative errors between the calculations and measurements
  are generally less than ±1.5%, even ±0.4% for high precision experimental data.
  At extremely low temperatures, the equations could smoothly switch to the theoretical
  limit predicted by the quantum theory.
