 abstract = {Resonance frequency of the thermoacoustic prime mover plays an important role in the thermoacoustically driven pulse tube refrigerator. The influences of structure parameters and working fluids on resonance frequency are discussed. With standing wave thermoacoustic engine as an example, corresponding computed results are given.},
