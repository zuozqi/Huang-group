abstract: 'Research question: Is vitrification with microinjection of single seminiferous
  tubules an efficient cryopreservation approach for limited testicular tissue? Design:
  Testicular tissue from 10 patients with normal spermatogenesis were assigned to
  a fresh control group or one of the following cryopreservation procedures: uncontrolled
  slow freezing (USF) using either 1.5 or 2.1 M DMSO combined with sucrose and vitrification
  with or without single seminiferous tubules microinjection. Results: Single seminiferous
  tubules microinjected with cryoprotective agents (CPA) enhanced the penetration
  of CPA compared with CPA-treated testicular tissue fragments. Microinjection of
  seminiferous tubules (VLP) maintained tubule structural integrity and germ cell
  numbers, and reduced spermatogonial apoptosis after cryopreservation compared with
  vitrification without microinjection (apoptosis rate: VLP versus vitrification without
  microinjection, P = 0.047; VLP versus USF, P= 0.049). Freezing of single seminiferous
  tubules using 0.25-ml straws and traditional sperm freezing methods protected sperm
  retrieval and recovery rates, and the progressive motility index. Conclusions: Vitrification
  of single seminiferous tubule with microinjection of low CPA concentration is an
  effective approach to testicular cryopreservation. Â© 2021'
