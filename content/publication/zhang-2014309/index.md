abstract: With the rapid growth in demand for industrial gas in steel and chemical
  industries, there has been significant emphasis placed on the development of China's
  large-scale air separation technology. Currently, the maximum capacity of a single
  unit has been able to attain 120 000 Nm3/h (oxygen), and the specific power consumption
  of 0.38 kWh/m3. This paper reviews the current state-of-the-art for large-scale
  cryogenic air separation systems being deployed in China. A brief introduction to
  the history and establishment of the large-scale cryogenic air separation industry
  is presented. Taking the present mainstream large-scale air separation unit operating
  at 60 000 Nm3/h (oxygen) as an example, the technological parameters and features
  of the involved key equipment, including a molecular sieve adsorber, air compressor
  unit, plate-fin heat exchanger, turbo-expander and distillation column are described
  in detail. The developing 80 000-120 000 Nm3/h air separation processes and equipment
  are also introduced. A summary of the existing problems and future developments
  of these systems in China are discussed. Â© Zhejiang University and Springer-Verlag
