abstract: A thorough literature survey was made to obtain all useful information relating
  to helium-3. Based on this fundamental work, the Gibbons' equation of state for
  3He in the gaseous region from 4K to 20K at pressures 0.1 MPa to 10MPa was tested
  and refitted, and a modified form was presented. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
