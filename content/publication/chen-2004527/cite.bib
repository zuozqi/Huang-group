 abstract = {The computation with the theory of modified Brayton Cycle indicates that higher cooling power and coefficient of performance for a pulse tube refrigerator can be achieved with He-H2 mixture as working gas than those with pure He in the temperature region of 30 K. In addition, it is found that Er3Ni, a regenerative material, is able to absorb H2 and produces Er3NiHx. The computation presents that the regenerative performance of Er3NiHx is better than that of Er3Ni due to its higher volume specific heat. Experimental results show that the pulse tube refrigeration performance in 30 K temperature region is enhanced greatly with He-H2 mixture and Er3NiH x packing.},
