abstract: To further discover the flow resistance characteristics of liquid nitrogen
  in bellows in wider application range, dimensionless variables namely the ratio
  of wave-height over bellows-diameter (e/d) and the ratio of wave-pitch over wave-height
  (p/e) are introduced. CFD modeling has been conducted on the behaviors of both pressure
  drop and Darcy friction factor (f) at different geometries of the bellows, either
  with or without an insert. Effects on the f by different Reynolds numbers at certain
  ratios e/d or p/e in wide ranges were investigated. The results shows that the vortex
  forming inside the bellows trough is the main cause of the flow resistance increment.
  When the e/d and p/e remain unchanged, changing of the inner diameter of the bellows
  has little influence on the friction factor. If a rod is inserted into the bellows,
  the larger the rod diameter, the smaller the Darcy friction factor. When the diameter
  of the insert reduces to zero, the friction factor approaches that of the hollow
  bellows, which is consistent with the experimental results. Â© 2018, Editorial Board
