abstract: A Ø2 m×2.2 m high-low temperature environment simulation chamber charged
  with helium gas was developed for testing aerospace products and their tolerance
  to high heating/cooling rate at extreme temperatures. The high cooling rate in the
  chamber was realized through a combination of forced convection and radiation heat
  transfer, which was significantly different from conventional thermal vacuum chambers.
  Using liquid nitrogen and a four-cylinder, as well as the two-stage Stirling cryogenerator
  as the cold sources, this paper conducted experimental study to test the results
  such as the achievable lower limit temperature and the cooling rates for approaching
  certain target temperatures. The Stirling cryogenerator enables the temperature
  of the heat sink to decrease to -210℃ when the chamber is precooled by liquid nitrogen,
  after which the helium gas inside is evacuated.
