abstract: Based on the computation of thermodynamic properties of binary inert gas
  fluids, He-Ar mixtures were used as working fluids to improve the refrigeration
  performance of a thermo acoustically driven pulse tube refrigerator. The experimental
  results indicated that the refrigeration performance with appropriate He-Ar mixtures
  was better than that of pure He.
