 abstract = {Due to the effect of surface tension, the process of fluid climbing along the inner wall at a certain angle in the microgravity environment is different from that of normal gravity. To study the physical process of capillary flow in microgravity, this paper uses the magnetic compensation method to set up a normal temperature magnetic fluid microgravity compensation experimental platform, which achieves magnetic compensation of less than 5% non-uniformity longitudinally in the target area. Visualized experimental research on the climb process of water-based magnetic fluid along the interior corner of different materials under the condition of different gravity is performed to verify the influence of contact angle and interior corner angle on the fluid transport capacity in the microgravity environment and to reveal the capillary flow law of the magnetic fluid in the microgravity environment. The results show that when the Concus-Finn condition is satisfied, the liquid surface climbing height and the gravity acceleration are approximately inversely proportional. The smaller the contact angle and interior corner angle, the stronger the fluid transport capacity of the material, especially in a good microgravity environment. When the Concus-Finn condition is not satisfied, the liquid surface climbing height and the acceleration of gravity have a linear relationship, and the impact of changes in contact angle and interior corner angle on the fluid transport capacity is not obvious. © 2020, Chemical Industry Press Co., Ltd.
