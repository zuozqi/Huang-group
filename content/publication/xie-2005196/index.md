abstract: A series of experiments were carried out to investigate cryogenic liquid
  transfer performance by self-pressurization method for liquid oxygen tank. The working
  fluid is nitrogen and the pressurizing gas is nitrogen including a small fraction
  of carbon dioxide, respectively. By varying the content of CO2 in the pressurizing
  gas, liquid oxygen gasifying pressurization mode and abundant oxygen pressurization
  mode are simulated. Besides, an experiment of CO2 crystallization in liquid nitrogen
  is also conducted. The experiments show that the modes of simulation test are feasible.
  The investigation provides a reference for further study.
