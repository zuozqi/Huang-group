abstract: 'Background: Cryopreservation of extremely few spermatozoa is still a major
  challenge for male fertility preservation. This study aims to evaluate the cooling
  rate, recovery rate, and retrieval rate, along with other parameters of spermatozoa
  that cryopreserved using Cryopiece, a novel carrier, for individual sperm cryopreservation.
  Methods: Semen samples from 60 fertile donors were collected, and each semen sample
  was screened for motile sperm and mixed with cryoprotective agent (CPA), and then
  frozen using Cryopiece, micro-straw, and mini-straws. The cooling rate, retrieval
  rate, and recovery rate, morphology, DNA fragmentation index (DFI) and mitochondrial
  membrane potential (MMP), were compared among the un-frozen sperm and the sperm
  cryopreserved using these carriers. Results: Cryopiece possessed the fastest cooling
  rate. After freeze-thaw, the average retrieval rate of sperm cryopreserved using
  Cryopiece was 96.25%, and the average recovery rate was 64.40%, which were higher
  than that of sperm cryopreserved using the other two carriers (71.42% and 54.30%
  for micro-straw, and 63.54% and 58.04% for mini-straw, respectively). There was
  no significant impact on DFI after sperm cryopreservation, and no significant difference
  in morphology between sperm cryopreserved using these carriers was observed. Though
  MMP of sperm changed significantly after cryopreservation, micro-straw maintained
  sperm MMP better than Cryopiece and mini-straw did, while no significant difference
  was observed in MMP between sperm cryopreserved using Cryopiece and mini-straw.
  Conclusions: Cryopiece produced satisfying retrieval and recovery rates in sperm
  cryopreservation and should be an ideal carrier for cryopreservation of small number
  of sperm. Â© Translational Andrology and Urology. All rights reserved.'
