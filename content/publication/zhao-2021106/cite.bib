 abstract = {Throttling is widely used in refrigeration, and is also involved in cryogenic liquefaction cycles such as Linde cycle, Claude cycle, J-T helium refrigeration cycle, and cryogenic propellant thermodynamic vent systems. In order to reveal the particularity of throttling effect of cryogenic fluids compared to ambient temperature gases and refrigerants, an experimental setup was designed and established to visualize two-phase cryogenic fluid throttling process. Taking a Laval nozzle as the testing element, the effects of inlet subcooling and pressure on throttling behavior of liquid nitrogen were investigated. The study showed that at given certain inlet pressure, the temperature drop and gas mass fraction increase with the inlet subcooling degree; at given certain inlet subcooling, the temperature drop and gas mass fraction increase with inlet pressure; higher inlet pressure and lower subcooling lead to lower refrigerating capacity. © 2021, Editorial Board of CIESC Journal.
