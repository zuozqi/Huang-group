abstract: Liquid hydrogen has been identified as a promising propellant for long-duration
  space missions, benefiting from its high specific impulse when paired with liquid
  oxygen. A full procedural computational fluid dynamic model was proposed for the
  jetting, mixing, throttling, and venting processes of thermodynamic venting systems
  (TVS) for the purpose of minimizing liquid hydrogen boil-off on orbit. In addition
  to the mixing and jetting components as well as the fluid domain inside the storage
  tank, the external fluid circulation loop and the throttling device were also coupled
  into the solver in the form of user-defined code, which enabled simulation of the
  continuous complete thermodynamic cycles. The evaporation/condensation intensity
  factors for the liquid-vapor phase change were confined in a smaller range than
  those used in other studies through theoretical analysis. To enhance the numerical
  stability, the well-known Lee model for liquid-vapor phase change was modified by
  introducing a smoothing function. Simulations with a variety of initial temperatures,
  mass flow-rates and vent ratios were conducted, which revealed that the condensation
  of superheated vapor contributes to the depressurization processes noticeably greater
  than the disturbance of the temperature stratification. Depressurization efficiency
  was introduced for evaluating the TVS performance during the jetting process. Significant
  performance enhancement was observed when the temperature difference between the
  liquid and the ullage before jetting was enlarged. The self-pressurization period
  was found lasting longer time under on-orbit condition than that on the ground,
  which is attributable to the floating of the bulk liquid and higher uniformity of
  the temperature distribution after the jetting process in the absence of gravity.
