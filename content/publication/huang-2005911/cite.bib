 abstract = {A thorough literature survey was made to obtain all useful information relating to helium-3. Based on this fundamental work, the Gibbons' equation of state for 3He in the gaseous region from 4K to 20K at pressures 0.1 MPa to 10MPa was tested and refitted, and a modified form was presented.
