abstract: Novel wicks made of micro/nanopillar array or carbon nanotube array have
  the advantages of superhigh capillary pressure and compact dimensions, which is
  attractive for applications like smartphones. However, much lower permeability becomes
  the dominant shortcoming compared to conventional wicking structures. This work
  presents an investigation of the effects of low-permeability wick on various aspects
  of the heat pipe performance, by assigning the permeability as the parametric control
  variable. The transient process as well as steady state have been numerically solved
  by an efficient heat pipe simulation tool LVHPM. Heat pipe performances with wicks
  covering a wide range of permeability have been studied in terms of the mass flow,
  temperature, and pressure influences. Calculation results showed that with decrease
  of the permeability, the growth of flow resistance in the wick is faster than the
  capillary pressure, resulting in lower capillary limit. Further, the effect of permeability
  on the coupled fluid flow and heat transfer inside the heat pipe was investigated,
  assuming that the heat load is within moderate range. The velocity was shown to
  be more evenly distributed for lower permeability, but the total mass flux was insensitive
  to it. Steady-state temperature distribution was weakly related to wick permeability,
  whereas the transient temperature presented stronger dependence with permeability,
  showing faster response at smaller permeability. During the transition of external
  heat loads, pressure drop inside the wick was found being established in a short
  time. Â© 2019 by Begell House, Inc.
