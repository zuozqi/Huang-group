abstract: Based on the collected experimental and smoothed p-ρ-T data, isochoric and
  isobaric specific heat capacity data, etc., p-H and T-S diagrams of 3He are plotted
  in the range of temperatures from 0.2 K to 20 K and pressures from 0.0001 MPa to
  20 MPa, with data calculated numerically instead of using an equation of state.
