abstract: Thermodynamic vent system (TVS) has been considered as a promising method
  for pressure control in cryogenic propellant tanks in microgravity environment.
  TVS could be operated in different modes, namely, the mixing-venting (MV) mode,
  the mixing-only (MO) mode, the mixing-only followed by mixing-venting (MOMV) mode,
  and the passive venting (PV) mode. An experimental investigation on the effect of
  operation mode on the TVS performance was conducted by using liquid nitrogen as
  the liquid oxygen simulant on a testing facility named Multi-functional Cryogenic
  Test System. Results of those four operating modes tests were compared regarding
  the ullage cooling effect, liquid temperature, pressure control capability, and
  mass loss. It was found that with the help of spraying, the MV mode and the MO mode
  cooled the ullage more effectively than the PV mode did. However, the PV mode is
  more effective in suppressing the increase of the liquid temperature. A non-dimensional
  parameter η has been proposed for comparison between the ullage heating and the
  liquid evaporation contribution to the pressurization in cryogenic fluid storage
  tanks. For the mixing-venting mode, the ullage heating is the main force that pressurizes
  the tank when the liquid is subcooled, while when the liquid is saturated, the evaporation
  takes over the role. Moreover, the MOMV mode performs the best in reducing mass
  loss within 0–1500 min. The results will be useful to make a control strategy for
  the operation of pressure control in on-orbit cryogenic tanks through thermodynamic
  venting method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd
