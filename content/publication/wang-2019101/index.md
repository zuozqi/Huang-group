abstract: In order to investigate the pressure control behavior of cryogenic propellant
  tank and operating performance of thermodynamic vent system (TVS), a set of high-efficiency
  cryogenic fluid storage platform with liquid nitrogen as storage medium was set
  up, to simulate the pressure variations of liquid oxygen tank under the operation
  of TVS. The single variable control method was used to carry out the experimental
  research, which concentrate on the pressure control of TVS in a liquid nitrogen
  (LN2) tank with different throttle rates and modes. The pressure, temperature variations
  and vent mass loss of LN2 tank under different throttling parameters were analyzed.
  It was found that the duty rate of TVS decreases significantly with the increase
  of throttle rate, and the cooling capacity of the system is increased, which greatly
  reduces the TVS operating time. Based on the principle of reducing the working time
  and fluid mass loss, the optimal throttling ratio of TVS is obtained. On the other
  hand, the throttle opening has a remarkable influence on the cooling power of TVS,
  the large pressure difference helps to improve the cooling power. © All Right Reserved.
