abstract: Thermodynamic vent system (TVS) is deemed as an efficient pressure control
  technique for long-term on-orbit storage of cryogenic propellants through fluid
  mixing and a combination of throttling and heat exchanging before venting. To conduct
  further study on the performance of tank pressure control by TVS under non-uniform
  heat flux, the effect of non-uniform heat flux (vapor heating only, liquid heating
  only and one side wall heating for both vapor and liquid) on self-pressurization
  characteristics and mass loss has been investigated experimentally on a TVS simulator,
  which works at room temperature and with R141b as the working fluid. The tank pressure
  rising rate, TVS operation performance, and vent mass loss of different heating
  condition were compared in detail. The results showed that under the condition of
  vapor heating mode, the rising rate of the tank pressure is the fastest, the TVS
  operation frequency and vent mass loss are the highest. However, under the condition
  of liquid heating mode, the rising rate of the tank pressure is the slowest, the
  TVS operation frequency and vent mass loss are the lowest, which decreased by 42%,
  29% and 33%, respectively, compared with the liquid heating mode. Considering the
  overall effect by the pressure rising rate, the thermal stratification of the fluid
  and the vent mass loss, the internal wall surface of the tank is better to have
  hydrophilic treatment or to integrate capillary structures to avoid direct heating
  of the ullage in micro-gravity environment. © 2018, Editorial Board of Journal of
