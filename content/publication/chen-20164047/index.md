abstract: In order to study the fundamental problems involved in the storage of cryogens
  in space, the experimental investigation of tank pressure control was carried out
  on a simulator of thermodynamic vent system (TVS), which works at room temperature
  with refrigerant R141b as working fluid. The pressure control characteristics were
  obtained at heat load of 120, 160 and 200 W. The test results showed that the self-pressurization
  rate were 6.43, 12.92 and 18.05 kPa·h-1 respectively at those three different heat
  load. Mass loss as a result of tank pressure control was compared between TVS method
  and direct gas vent method. Taking the heat load of 120 W as an example, the mass
  loss can be reduced by 79.3%. Assuming the mixture vented directly at zero-gravity
  containing 40% liquid, the TVS method can reduce the mass loss even by up to 84.7%.
  It was proved that the TVS method cannot only control the tank pressure but also
  significantly reduce the loss of the storage fluid. © All Right Reserved.
