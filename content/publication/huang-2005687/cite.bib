 abstract = {Based on the collected experimental and smoothed p-ρ-T data, isochoric and isobaric specific heat capacity data, etc., p-H and T-S diagrams of 3He are plotted in the range of temperatures from 0.2 K to 20 K and pressures from 0.0001 MPa to 20 MPa, with data calculated numerically instead of using an equation of state. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
