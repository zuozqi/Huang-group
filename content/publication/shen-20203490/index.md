abstract: Due to the effect of surface tension, the process of fluid climbing along
  the inner wall at a certain angle in the microgravity environment is different from
  that of normal gravity. To study the physical process of capillary flow in microgravity,
  this paper uses the magnetic compensation method to set up a normal temperature
  magnetic fluid microgravity compensation experimental platform, which achieves magnetic
  compensation of less than 5% non-uniformity longitudinally in the target area. Visualized
  experimental research on the climb process of water-based magnetic fluid along the
  interior corner of different materials under the condition of different gravity
  is performed to verify the influence of contact angle and interior corner angle
  on the fluid transport capacity in the microgravity environment and to reveal the
  capillary flow law of the magnetic fluid in the microgravity environment. The results
  show that when the Concus-Finn condition is satisfied, the liquid surface climbing
  height and the gravity acceleration are approximately inversely proportional. The
  smaller the contact angle and interior corner angle, the stronger the fluid transport
  capacity of the material, especially in a good microgravity environment. When the
  Concus-Finn condition is not satisfied, the liquid surface climbing height and the
  acceleration of gravity have a linear relationship, and the impact of changes in
  contact angle and interior corner angle on the fluid transport capacity is not obvious.
