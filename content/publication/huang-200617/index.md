abstract: A framework of the state equation for cryogenic fluid 3He is constructed.
  Temperature and density are treated as the independent input variables and Helmholtz
  energy is used as the dependent variable. All other thermodynamic property expressions
  are derived from Helmholtz energy with respect to temperature or density or both
  of them. The form of the state equation and the derived property expressions together
  show the thermodynamic consistency, feasibility and advantages of the framework.
