 abstract = {To study the pressure control of cryogenic propellant container, an analytical lumped parameter model is established to predict the behavior of pressure variation inside a liquid hydrogen tank with TVS installed.Simulations are conducted for the tank with volume of 18.09 m3 initially filled with 75% LH2 and with a heat leak load of 0.76 W·m-2.Calculation results are compared with literature to verify the feasibility of the proposed model.The results show that the ullage pressure rises much faster than the liquid saturation pressure, and TVS is highly effective and feasible in controlling the tank pressure within 165.5-172.4 kPa.The pressure change characteristics under mixing mode and venting mode are compared and analyzed.The pressure decreasing rate under venting mode is found to be 7 times of that under mixing mode.However, the pressure rising rate under venting mode is about 95% of that under mixing mode.The temperature profiles are also studied. © All Right Reserved.},
