abstract: The long-term storage of cryogenic propellants on orbit under thermal and
  pressure control is a promising enabling technology for future space exploration.
  Composite insulation composed of polyurethane foam (Foam), variable density multilayer
  insulation (VD-MLI), and a vapor-cooled shield (VCS) is considered as an effective
  passive thermal control method for such missions. This paper presents a theoretical
  model that considers three heat transfer mechanisms simultaneously within the VD-MLI
  and convective heat transfer inside the VCS, to predict and optimize the thermal
  performance of the insulation combination. The model is validated by experimental
  data. The influences of VCS position and warm boundary temperature (heat flux) on
  the thermal insulation performance are investigated for LH2, LN2, LO2, and LCH4
  tanks. The temperature profiles within the insulation material with or without VCS
  are compared. In addition, the contributions from the VCS to reduce the heat flux
  into the tank are evaluated. The conclusions are valuable for the optimal design
  of future composite insulation with Foam/VCS/VD-MLI for cryogenic storage tanks
  on orbit. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd
