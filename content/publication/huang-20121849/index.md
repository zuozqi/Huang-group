abstract: Measurements on thermal conductivity of fluid helium-3 in the literature
  are abundant in the liquid phase, while almost no data are available in the gas
  phase except some at pressures not higher than 0.1 MPa. A quantum version of the
  principle of corresponding states is used to predict the thermal conductivity of
  gaseous helium-3 by using those of helium-4, hydrogen, neon and argon. An empirical
  equation is developed for the thermal conductivity of both the liquid and gas phases
  at temperatures from 3 mK to 300 K and pressures up to 20 MPa. Similar to other
  cryogenic fluids like nitrogen, a sharp peak of the thermal conductivity curve is
  observed at low pressures. Â© 2012 American Institute of Physics.
