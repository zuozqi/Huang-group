abstract: A density equation for saturated vapor and liquid 3He is presented based
  on 205 experimental measurements for temperatures greater than 0.2 K collected after
  a careful survey of the literature. The average deviation of the densities predicted
  by the equation against the experimental values is 0.39%. There are only 16 points
  with deviations larger than 1%. This equation is valid for both liquid and vapor
  densities of 3He up to the critical temperature of 3.3157 K. The form of the equation
  satisfies known scaling laws approaching the critical point, with β=0.3653. In the
  low-density limit, the vapor curve of our equation matches smoothly to the published
  virial equation density at a temperature of 1.62 K and at the saturation pressure.
  The rectilinear density deviates from the critical density by less than 0.28% down
  to 0.48 K. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.
