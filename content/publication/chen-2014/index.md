abstract: Experimental results reported in the last decade on the thermal conductivity
  of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have shown a fairly divergent behavior. An underlying
  intrinsic consistency was believed to exist in spite of the divergence in the thermal
  conductivity data of various CNTs. A dimenisonless equation that describes the temperature
  dependence of thermal conductivity was derived by introducing reduced forms relative
  to a chosen reference point. This equation can serve as a practical approximation
  to characterize the conductivity of individual CNT with different structural parameters
  as well as bulk CNT arrays with different bundle configurations. Comparison of predictions
  by the equation and historical measurements showed good agreements within their
  uncertainties. Â© 2014 Author(s).
