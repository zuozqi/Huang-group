abstract: A new form of a state equation for helium-3 in wide range of temperature
  and pressure, based on a conceptual extrapolation from the Debye equation for specific
  heat of solid materials was previously developed. A deeper look into the performance
  of the state equation was recently considered necessary and valuable, due to some
  feedback from cryogenic applications. The evaluation of has been conducted with
  the Grüneisen parameter along isobar and isotherms, cubic sound velocity - pressure
  linearity, enthalpy and entropy at low pressures, and the virial coefficients as
  the benchmarks. Some similar analysis was applied to helium-4 for the sake of analogizing
  the common behavior of these isotopes, particularly in the critical region. The
  results confirmed the good thermodynamic perfection of the Debye state equation
  for helium-3 in most areas on the phase diagram as declared before. © 2015 The Authors.
