abstract: To study the pressure control of cryogenic propellant container, an analytical
  lumped parameter model is established to predict the behavior of pressure variation
  inside a liquid hydrogen tank with TVS installed.Simulations are conducted for the
  tank with volume of 18.09 m3 initially filled with 75% LH2 and with a heat leak
  load of 0.76 W·m-2.Calculation results are compared with literature to verify the
  feasibility of the proposed model.The results show that the ullage pressure rises
  much faster than the liquid saturation pressure, and TVS is highly effective and
  feasible in controlling the tank pressure within 165.5-172.4 kPa.The pressure change
  characteristics under mixing mode and venting mode are compared and analyzed.The
  pressure decreasing rate under venting mode is found to be 7 times of that under
  mixing mode.However, the pressure rising rate under venting mode is about 95% of
  that under mixing mode.The temperature profiles are also studied. © All Right Reserved.
