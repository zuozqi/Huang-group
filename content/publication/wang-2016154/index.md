abstract: Cryogenic propellant storage on orbit is a crucial part of future space
  exploration. Efficient and reliable thermal insulation is one of the dominant technologies
  for the long-duration missions. This paper presents theoretical and experimental
  investigation on the thermal performance of variable density multilayer insulation
  (VDMLI) with different configurations and spacers. A practical method for optimizing
  the configuration of VDMLI was proposed by iteratively predicting the internal temperature
  profiles and maximizing the thermal resistance based on the basic layer by layer
  model. A cryogen boil-off calorimeter system was designed and fabricated to measure
  the temperature profile and effective heat transfer coefficient of the VDMLI samples
  over a wide range of temperature (77–353 K). The experimental data confirm that
  the optimized sample as predicted does have the minimum effective heat transfer
  coefficient in the control group. The results indicated that the insulation performance
  of MLI could be improved by 45.5% after replacing the regular uniform configuration
  with the optimized variable density configuration. For the same optimized configuration,
  the performance was further improved by 54% by changing the spacing material from
  none-woven fiber cloth to Dacron net. It was also found that the effective heat
  transfer coefficient will be much less sensitive to the MLI thickness when it exceeds
  30 mm for on-orbit thermal environment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd
