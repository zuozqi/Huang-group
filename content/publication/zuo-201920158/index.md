abstract: Thermal stratification of cryogenic propellants under the condition of external
  heat leakage is a dominating factor pressurizing the storage tank, which hinders
  long-term on-orbit storage missions for future explorations. Whether a thermodynamic
  venting system or cryocooler is introduced to reduce the boil-off losses or even
  realize zero boil-off of the cryogens, an efficient mixing and heat-exchanging device
  is a prerequisite for eliminating thermal stratification. Usually, a subcooled stream
  is introduced, which is injected into the tank through the nozzles on a spray bar.
  Early research provided evidence that the cooling effect is related to the arrangement
  of the nozzles. In contrast to adopting a heavy plate spray bar to realize the temperature
  profile symmetry along the tank axis, this study proposes an assembly with a rotatable
  nozzle head to diminish the temperature non-uniformity in the tank. In this manner,
  over 70% of the spray bar payload can be saved compared to the plate configuration.
  A three-dimensional model was established to investigate the temperature distribution
  of liquid hydrogen at zero gravity in a tank containing such a rotatable sprayer,
  which was passively driven by the counterforce of the injection flow, and therefore
  excluded an extra power drive demand. The injection inlet velocity, as well as the
  length and quantity of the nozzle arms, were analyzed parametrically to optimize
  the destratification performance. By employing the self-spinning sprayer, the standard
  deviation of the temperature in the tank could be lowered, along with the benefits
  of a significant payload reduction and elimination of direct power input. Â© 2019
