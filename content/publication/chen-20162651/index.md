abstract: Micro-pillar array is widely applied to manipulate the wettability of surfaces.
  Cases where liquid has infiltrated such pillar arrays completely are drawing increased
  attention in miniaturized systems. An equivalent surface tension model is proposed
  to characterize the driving force of liquid evolution in patterned micro-pillar
  arrays after the Young-Laplace equation and surface energy analysis are applied
  on both the pillar unit and bulk liquid levels. The effects of local menisci induced
  from the wetting of pillars are bounded and treated as “equivalent liquid-vapor
  surface tension”, through which the bulk liquid profile is then obtained based on
  the principle of minimal surface energy. The model is found to be computationally
  efficient and can be easily obtained through numerical methods. A typical sample
  case is presented to demonstrate its advantages and simplicity. The bulk profile
  that considers the effects of pillar array is compared with the result without pillars.
  The influencing effects, including apparent tilt angle, pillar spacing, and pillar
  shape, are addressed. © 2016, The Korean Society of Mechanical Engineers and Springer-Verlag
