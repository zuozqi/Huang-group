abstract: On the basis of the equation of state and the phase equilibrium equations
  of helium-3 ( 3He), a computer program for calculating the thermodynamic properties
  of 3He has been created. With this program, many iso-property tables were prepared
  for generating p-h and T-s diagrams of 3He over the range of temperature from 0.2K
  to 300 K and pressures up to 300MPa. Compared with the previous diagrams plotted
  with interpolated experimental data sets, the new ones are more thermodynamically
  consistent and cover a broader temperature and pressure range. The estimated overall
  random errors of the diagrams are within 2%. Â© Springer Science+Business Media,
