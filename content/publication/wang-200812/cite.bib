 abstract = {Based on the ideal gas state equation and the saturated vapor pressure equation of helium-3, a saturated vapor density equation is proposed, which can be applied for calculating the saturated vapor density of helium-3 from 0.01 K to the critical temperature. Above 1.4 K, the average deviation between the results by this equation and experimental data is about 0.66% and the maximum is 2%. Below 1.4 K, the results of this work show a comfortable agreement with those by virial state equation (the deviations are generally within 0.1%). Based on this new vapor density equation, the compressibility factor of saturated vapor is determined and the vaporization heat is calculated. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
