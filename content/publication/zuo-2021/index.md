abstract: Evaporation is a ubiquitous non-equilibrium phenomenon which plays a vital
  role in both micro and macro phase transition systems. Leading evaporation theories,
  such as the kinetic gas theory and the statistical rate theory, rely on the interfacial
  temperature data to predict the mass flux. Compared to water and other room temperature
  fluids, the interfacial temperature measurement for cryogenic fluids were seldom
  reported, which means the evaporation calculations at cryogenic temperatures have
  to use regular correlations or coefficients developed from non-cryogenic fluids.
  In the present study, a visualized and controlled evaporation system was designed
  and fabricated. Liquid oxygen was used as the testing fluid since it is the common
  oxidant of the cryogenic propellants. The temperature distributions in the interfacial
  regions of steady-state evaporating liquid oxygen were obtained at a set of mass
  flux and pressure. Temperature discontinuities up to 0.79 K were observed across
  the liquid–vapor interface of evaporating oxygen. It was found that the liquid was
  overheated. The measurement implied that the examined evaporation theories lose
  their accuracy in predicting mass flux rate and temperature jump at cryogenic temperatures
  by deviations on several orders of magnitude. A modified expression for the evaporation
  coefficient was provided which shows higher accuracy than early expressions especially
  in atmospheric pressure regions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd
