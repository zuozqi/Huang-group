abstract: Thermodynamic vent system (TVS) is deemed as an efficient pressure control
  technique for long-term on-orbit storage of cryogenic propellants through fluid
  mixing and a combination of throttling and heat exchanging before venting. Three
  control strategies have been proposed to automate the mixing mode and venting mode
  of the TVS. The effects of these control strategies on liquid temperature, stratification
  and mass loss are investigated on a TVS simulator, which works at room temperature
  with R141b as the working fluid. The results show that the TVS can not only achieve
  a significant vent loss but also lower liquid temperatures and weaker stratification
  when one of the strategies is applied whose mixing mode operates based on ullage
  pressure and the vent mode is controlled based on both the ullage pressure and the
  bulk liquid temperature. This investigation provides guidance for the design and
  operation of cryogenic TVS. © All Right Reserved.
