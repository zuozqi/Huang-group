abstract: Pressure drop behavior of cryogenic flow in corrugated pipes is one of the
  most important design parameters for high temperature superconducting (HTS) power
  transmission line systems. Most studies on pressure loss and temperature rise study
  the liquid nitrogen flow in annularly corrugated pipes focused on the pipe geometries.
  However, the positioning and configuration of the HTS cables in the corrugated shell
  tube are of great concern in practical application. In addition, helically corrugated
  pipes are more popular than annular ones for long distance deployment of HTS transmission
  lines. This paper focuses on the influence of inserted cable configuration in helically
  corrugated pipes on the surrounding subcooled liquid nitrogen flow. Triple and quadruple
  cables with diameters of 5 mm and 8 mm configured in different forms in a Φ40 mm
  helically corrugated pipe are comparatively studied with a 3D model. Results show
  that the Darcy friction factor is related to the pitch of the cables. The gaps and
  the cable size will directly influence the level of friction loss in the pipe. ©
