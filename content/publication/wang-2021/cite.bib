 abstract = {The study of pressure flow through wire screens has attracted considerable attention as these screens are employed in various engineering applications. This paper presents an analytical model for a flow-through-screen (FTS) friction factor considering the effects of the pore structures. The pressure drop is quantified using an integrated form of the Forchheimer equation, where permeability is expressed as a function of screen parameters, including pore diameter, tortuosity, constriction factor, and porosity. Each parameter is determined solely from the pore-scale morphology of various weaves, and hence, the accurate expression for each screen is derived without introducing additional fitting constants. The results obtained using the proposed model are corroborated by 1500 + data points from existing literature with a mean absolute relative error of 23.0%, focusing on four types of typical wire screens—Plain Square, Twilled Square, Plain Dutch, and Dutch Twill—and both room-temperature and cryogenic fluids in the Reynolds number range of 0.1<Re<1000. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},
