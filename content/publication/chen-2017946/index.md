abstract: A thermodynamic vent system with refrigerant R141b as working substance
  has been established for the purpose of revealing the primary principle and validating
  a modeling program. The experimental TVS was installed within a tank with a 450
  mm inner diameter cylinder and two under development elliptical domes, and has a
  total volume of 0.11 m3 approximately. Tests of pressure control under the action
  of spray bar alone and the joint action of spray bar, throttle valve and heat exchanger
  were conducted with representative input heat and fill level. The results showed
  that the experimental system could successfully control the ullage gauge pressure
  between 80 and 90 kPa for 0.98 hour by operating the spray bar alone, while in the
  combined operation mode only 5.8% (3.35 kg) of R141b was vented in 2 hours. The
  ability of this system for simulating the thermodynamic vent process of evaporative
  fluids was validated. Â© 2017, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Press. All right reserved.
