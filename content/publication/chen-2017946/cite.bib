 abstract = {A thermodynamic vent system with refrigerant R141b as working substance has been established for the purpose of revealing the primary principle and validating a modeling program. The experimental TVS was installed within a tank with a 450 mm inner diameter cylinder and two under development elliptical domes, and has a total volume of 0.11 m3 approximately. Tests of pressure control under the action of spray bar alone and the joint action of spray bar, throttle valve and heat exchanger were conducted with representative input heat and fill level. The results showed that the experimental system could successfully control the ullage gauge pressure between 80 and 90 kPa for 0.98 hour by operating the spray bar alone, while in the combined operation mode only 5.8% (3.35 kg) of R141b was vented in 2 hours. The ability of this system for simulating the thermodynamic vent process of evaporative fluids was validated. © 2017, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Press. All right reserved.},
