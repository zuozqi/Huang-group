abstract: Cryopreservation of few spermatozoa is still a major challenge for male
  fertility preservation. This study reports use a new micro-straw (LSL straw) for
  freezing few spermatozoa for intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Semen samples
  from 22 fertile donors were collected, and each semen sample was diluted and mixed
  with cryoprotectant in a ratio of 1:1, and then frozen using three different straws
  such as LSL straw (50-100 μl), traditional 0.25 ml and 0.5 ml straws. For freezing,
  all straws were fumigated with liquid nitrogen, with temperature directly reducing
  to-130-140°C. Sperm concentration, progressive motility, morphology, acrosome integrity,
  and DNA fragmentation index were evaluated before and after freezing. After freezing-thawing,
  LSL straw group had significantly higher percentage of sperm motility than traditional
  0.25 ml and 0.5 ml straw groups (38.5% vs 27.4% and 25.6%, P < 0.003). Sperm motility
  and acrosomal integrity after freezing-thawing were significantly lower than that
  of before freezing. However, there was no significant difference in morphology,
  acrosome, and DNA integrity between the three types of straws (P > 0.05). As LSL
  straws were thinner and hold very small volume, the freezing rate of LSL straw was
  obviously faster than 0.25 ml straw and 0.5 ml straws. In conclusion, LSL micro-straws
  may be useful to store few motile spermatozoa with good recovery of motility for
  patients undergoing ICSI treatment. © 2016 AJA, SIMM & SJTU. All rights reserved.
