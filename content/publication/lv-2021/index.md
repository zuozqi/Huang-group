abstract: The primary challenge for the long-term storage of cryogens in space is
  evaporation and consequent pressurization due to heat leakage. This study innovatively
  presents the scale effects on pressurization covering a wide range of tank volume
  from 6.37×10-3 to 208 m3, under normal gravity and microgravity. A computational
  fluid dynamic model based on the volume-of-fluid method is constructed to predict
  the thermodynamic behaviors in partially filled hydrogen tanks. The geometric scale
  is found to play a significant role in influencing the pressurization rate only
  for tanks in the small-scale range, especially under normal gravity. The pressurization
  rate is lower under microgravity than under normal gravity for small tanks. However,
  the opposite is observed when the tank size exceeds a critical value. An empirical
  correlation is originally presented to relate the real pressurization rate to the
  tank diameter and the pressurization rate based on homogeneous model. According
  to a thermodynamic analysis, the direct sensible energy input of vapor, the mass
  transfer on the liquid-vapor interface, and the liquid thermal expansion are the
  three causes of self-pressurization, which are all related to the geometric scale.
  The conclusions can be used for the pressurization prediction of various emissions
  in the aerospace applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd
