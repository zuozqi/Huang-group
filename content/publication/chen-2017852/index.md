abstract: The heat transfer capability of conventional materials like copper or devices
  like heat pipes are challenged by the growing trend of miniaturization of integrated
  circuit and exponentially increasing density of heat generation. Vertically aligned
  carbon nanotube (CNT) array has been recognized as a promising wicking structure
  of new generation heat pipes for higher heat transfer capability and more compact
  size. In contrast to conventional grooved or powder-sintered wicks, the CNT wick
  behaves differently due to the scale effects, which has been investigated through
  physical models extracted from its working conditions. The influence by the velocity
  slip of the liquid at the CNT wall is evaluated, which shows that the slip leads
  to considerable enhancement of the flow near the CNT wall. Calculation of the overall
  flow resistance indicates higher permeability due to the slip. The gaps between
  CNTs create exceptionally high capillary pressure due to the nanoscale pores. It
  proves to be apparently superior to conventional structures in micrometer scale.
  The effective thermal conductance of the CNT wick benefits from the extremely high
  thermal conductivity of CNTs thanks to the non-Fourier conduction. The effects emerged
  in the non-evaporating and thin-film regions are analyzed, which clearly shows that
  the evaporation at the liquid-vapor interface is dramatically affected by these
  nanoscale effects. The present study on scale effects identifies the advantages
  of the CNT wick in capillary ability, effective conductivity, and evaporative flux,
  etc. Meanwhile, it also reveals the disadvantage of relatively lower dry-out limit
  of the CNT wick. Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd
