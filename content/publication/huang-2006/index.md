abstract: An equation of state for 3He using the Helmholtz potential function has
  been developed. The lower limit of the equation of 0.01 K is safely above the superfluid
  transition at 0.0026 K. The upper limit of 60 K is approximately the upper limit
  of available 3He property measurements. The new state equation form is based on
  Debye function which goes smoothly to zero in the limit of zero temperature and
  reduces to the ideal gas in the limit of zero density and/or very high temperature.
  The equation combines (a) necessary temperature-independent compressibility terms
  at the lowest temperatures, (b) terms describing the linear specific heat of a Fermi
  fluid below 1 K, (c) terms describing the phonon excitations which begin above about
  1 K, and (d) terms which attempt to fit the conventional critical point thermodynamics
  at 3.3157 K and 114 604 Pa. State properties, e.g., p-V-T relations, specific heats,
  thermal expansion, sound velocity, etc., are determined from the Helmholtz energy
  by standard thermodynamics. Transport properties, e.g., thermal conductivity and
  viscosity, are not obtained in this work. Â© 2006 American Institute of Physics.
