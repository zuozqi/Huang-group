abstract: The helium-4 working fluid in regenerative cryocoolers operating with the
  cold end near 4 K deviates considerably from an ideal gas. As a result, losses in
  the regenerator, given by the time-averaged enthalpy flux, are increased and are
  strong functions of the operating pressure and temperature. Helium-3, with its lower
  boiling point, behaves somewhat closer to an ideal gas in this low temperature range
  and can reduce the losses in 4 K regenerators. An analytical model is used to find
  the fluid properties that strongly influence the regenerator losses as well as the
  gross refrigeration power. The thermodynamic and transport properties of helium-3
  were incorporated into the latest NIST regenerator numerical model, known as REGEN3.3,
  which was used to model regenerator performance with either helium-4 or helium-3.
  With this model we show how the use of helium-3 in place of helium-4 can improve
  the performance of 4 K regenerative cryocoolers. The effects of operating pressure,
  warm-end temperature, and frequency on regenerators with helium-4 and helium-3 are
  investigated and compared. The results are used to find optimum operating conditions.
  The frequency range investigated varies from 1 Hz to 30 Hz, with particular emphasis
  on higher frequencies. Â© 2008 American Institute of Physics.
