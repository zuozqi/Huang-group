abstract: A coupled set of new 3He vapor pressure equations have been developed in
  the range from 2.6 mK to the critical temperature, which has greatly extended the
  lower limit of the ITS-90 temperature scale. In the overlapped interval from 0.65
  K to 3.2 K, the new equation smoothly joins with the ITS-90 3He equation to within
  +/-50 μK for a given pressure. © 2006 American Institute of Physics.
