abstract: An equation of state for 3He using the Helmholtz potential function has
  been obtained from available published experimental data. The lower limit of the
  equation 0.01 K is safely above the superfluid transition at 0.0026K. The upper
  limit of 20 K is approximately the upper limit of available 3He properties measurements.
  The new state equation form is based on Debye functions which go smoothly to zero
  in the limit of zero temperature, and reduce to the ideal gas in the limit of zero
  density and/or very high temperature. The equation combines (a) necessary temperature-independent
  compressibility terms at the lowest temperatures, (b) terms describing the linear
  specific heat of a Fermi fluid below 1 K, (c) terms describing the phonon excitations
  which begin above about 1 K, and (d) terms which attempt to fit the conventional
  critical point thermodynamics at 3.3157 K and 114604 Pa. State properties, e.g.,
  p-V-T relations, specific heats, thermal expansion, sound velocity, etc., are determined
  from the Helmholtz energy by standard thermodynamics. Transport properties, e.g.,
  thermal conductivity and viscosity, are not obtained in this work. Â© 2006 American
