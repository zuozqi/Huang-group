abstract: A saturation vapor pressure equation, p(T), is an essential component in
  the 3He state equation currently under development. The state equation is valid
  over the range 0.01-20 K with pressures from 0 to the melting pressure or 15 MPa.
  The vapor pressure equation consequently must be valid from 0.01 K to the critical
  temperature. This paper surveys available 3He critical temperature and pressure
  measurements, leading to new recommended critical values of 3.3157 K and 114603.91
  Pa. The ITS-90 temperature scale is defined by the 3He vapor pressure from 0.65
  to 3.2 K. A new vapor pressure equation is developed for the interval from the upper
  end of the T90 scale to this newly defined critical point, employing a mathematical
  form in which the second derivative d2p/dT2 diverges in agreement with scaling laws
  at the critical point. Below 0.65 K, an empirical vapor pressure expression is adopted,
  consistent with a theoretical expression valid in the limit T → 0. These two new
  components are fitted to be piecewise continuous with the EPT-76 p(T) scale rather
  than the ITS-90 T(p) scale between 0.65 and 3.2 K. Probable deviations between this
  vapor pressure scale and PLTS-2000 melting pressure-temperature scale are recognized,
  but not reconciled. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
