abstract: Almost all experimental and theoretical studies on regenerative cryocoolers
  at temperatures below 20 K mention the use of 4He as working fluid. A preliminary
  qualitative evaluation indicates that because of the superfluid phase transition,
  a working fluid of 3He would overcome the cooling temperature limitation set by
  4He. Starting with a comparison of the thermophysical properties of 4He, cryogenic
  regenerator simulations applied to the third/last stage of a pulse tube refrigerator,
  with 3He and 4He separately, were implemented to quantitatively analyze performance
  differences of the regenerator with respect to regenerator loss, cooling power and
  COP. Results conclude that 3He could significantly improve the performance of a
  regenerative cryocooler. Â© 2011 The Author(s).
