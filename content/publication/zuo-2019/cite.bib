 abstract = {Pressure drop behavior of cryogenic flow in corrugated pipes is one of the most important design parameters for high temperature superconducting (HTS) power transmission line systems. Most studies on pressure loss and temperature rise study the liquid nitrogen flow in annularly corrugated pipes focused on the pipe geometries. However, the positioning and configuration of the HTS cables in the corrugated shell tube are of great concern in practical application. In addition, helically corrugated pipes are more popular than annular ones for long distance deployment of HTS transmission lines. This paper focuses on the influence of inserted cable configuration in helically corrugated pipes on the surrounding subcooled liquid nitrogen flow. Triple and quadruple cables with diameters of 5 mm and 8 mm configured in different forms in a Φ40 mm helically corrugated pipe are comparatively studied with a 3D model. Results show that the Darcy friction factor is related to the pitch of the cables. The gaps and the cable size will directly influence the level of friction loss in the pipe. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},
