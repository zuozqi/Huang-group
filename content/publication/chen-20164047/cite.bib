 abstract = {In order to study the fundamental problems involved in the storage of cryogens in space, the experimental investigation of tank pressure control was carried out on a simulator of thermodynamic vent system (TVS), which works at room temperature with refrigerant R141b as working fluid. The pressure control characteristics were obtained at heat load of 120, 160 and 200 W. The test results showed that the self-pressurization rate were 6.43, 12.92 and 18.05 kPa·h-1 respectively at those three different heat load. Mass loss as a result of tank pressure control was compared between TVS method and direct gas vent method. Taking the heat load of 120 W as an example, the mass loss can be reduced by 79.3%. Assuming the mixture vented directly at zero-gravity containing 40% liquid, the TVS method can reduce the mass loss even by up to 84.7%. It was proved that the TVS method cannot only control the tank pressure but also significantly reduce the loss of the storage fluid. © All Right Reserved.},
