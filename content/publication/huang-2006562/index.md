abstract: Based on a thorough survey of experimental data and theoretical correlations,
  a melting pressure equation for 3He valid in a wide range was developed. This nonsegment
  equation, in SI unit, precisely describes the pressure and temperature relation
  along the melting curve of 3He at temperatures from 0.001 K to 30 K. The maximum
  and the average differences between calculations by the melting pressure equation
  and 406 measurements are 3.02% and 0.106%, respectively. A minimum pressure 2.93113
  MPa is predicted at 0.31586 K, which agrees with early experimental and theoretical
  studies fairly well.
