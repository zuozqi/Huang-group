abstract: With liquid nitrogen as coolant, a simple thermal expansion coefficient
  measurement apparatus for solid materials was developed based on a micrometer.It
  can be applied in the temperature range from 80 K to 353 K.The thermal expansion
  coefficient of serval typical materials such as copper T1, aluminum 6060, stainless
  steel 304, nylon and epoxy G10 were measured and compared with literature data.The
  repeatability and relative uncertainty of the present data were found to be higher
  than 99.3% and less than 3.34%, respectively.The maximum relative deviation and
  the mean deviation between the measuring data and literature data were less than
  6.0% and 3.1% respectively in the temperature range from 80 K to 353 K. Based on
  the verification, the expansion coefficient of some other materials widely applied
  in high/low temperature environment engineering such as invar, aluminum 6062, stainless
  steel 316, carbon steel 45, Teflon and ABS plastics were also measured. Â© All Right
