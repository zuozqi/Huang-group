 abstract = {An accuracy satisfying density equation of saturated vapor and liquid Hc is obtained by nonlinear regression based on experimental data collected after a thorough survey of literatures. This equation not only can be used to calculate saturated density of 3He independently, but also is to be of great significance in building the equation of state for 3He in both gas and liquid regions. For a better understanding of the equation, the saturated density curves of He and He are compared. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
