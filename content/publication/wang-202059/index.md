abstract: The interface distribution and self-pressurization phenomenon are the most
  important problems in the storage of cryogenic liquid on orbit, which are difficult
  to be predicted and assessed exactly due to the complex non-equilibrium thermal
  behavior. In this paper, one 3-D CFD model based on volume of fluid (VOF) method
  is established to investigate the interface evolution and self-pressurization process
  in the liquid oxygen (LOX) tank in microgravity environment with various heat loads
  and gravitational accelerations. The validity of the model is verified by both the
  present ground experiments and the drop tower experiments from literature. The impact
  of microgravity on the gas-liquid interface distribution in the cryogenic tank is
  analyzed. Different from the ground condition, the distribution behavior of the
  gas-liquid two-phase fluid in microgravity is that the liquid is covering the tank
  wall, and the ullage is staying at the top of the tank surrounded by the liquid.
  Then the pressurization rate of the tank with different gravitational accelerations
  is obtained. The tank pressure rise rate increases with the reducing of the gravity.
  The results are beneficial to the optimal design of the cryogenic propellant tank.
