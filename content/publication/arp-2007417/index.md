abstract: A new form of a fluid state equation, based on a conceptual extrapolation
  from the Debye equation for the specific heat of solid materials is described. The
  Debye characteristic temperature, Θ, which is nominally a constant for solids, becomes
  a function of the fluid density ρ. Further assuming yields the conventional fluid
  virial equation in the high-T and low-ρ limits for a monatomic fluid. Additional
  terms must be added to describe (a) the compressibility of the dense subcooled fluid
  and (b) properties in the near-critical range. Discussion of the Gruneisen parameter
  and other factors is included. This Debye fluid theory was used as a state equation
  for 3He, continuous from 0.005 K to above room temperature. © Springer Science+Business
