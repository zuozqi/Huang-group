abstract: 'Vertically aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) arrays exhibit distinct wetting
  characteristics. Thus, they are a promising solution for many applications such
  as heat-pipe wicks. In this study, the dynamic behavior of liquid-droplet spreading
  via capillary action in a vertically aligned CNT array has been investigated experimentally
  and theoretically. Two groups of CNT array with heights of 150 μm and 250 μm were
  tested. Two organic solvents, namely ethanol and acetone, were selected as the wetting
  liquids because of their good wettability with the as-grown CNTs. A visualization
  system equipped with a high-speed camera was used to record the capillary-spreading
  process. The results of the CNT array with different array heights showed two distinct
  modes of spreading: a steady uniform mode and an unsteady random mode. In the unsteady
  mode, the liquid predominantly spreads above the array. In the steady mode, the
  spreading process can be divided into three phases based on the different dominating
  effects. After the first flooding phase, the spreading in the second phase was found
  to follow the Lucas–Washburn model, whereas the third phase can be described using
  a constant evaporation-rate model. The self-assembly behavior was observed using
  an SEM after the wetting experiments. Honeycomb-shaped microstructures were formed
  spontaneously in the precursor-film region, whereas striped lines were observed
  on the front end of the contact line. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd'
