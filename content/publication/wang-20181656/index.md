abstract: In order to discover the pressurization and thermal stratification behavior
  of cryogenic propellant tank, experimental investigation on a liquid nitrogen (LN
  2 ) tank with the volume of 1.31 m 3 was conducted on the Efficient Cryogenic Fluid
  Storage Platform (ECFSP), which concentrates on the effects of filling rate and
  gaseous helium (GHe) pressurization on the thermal stratification performance of
  LN 2 . The pressurization rates without GHe at fill rate of 35%, 50% and 65% were
  measured as 7.54 kPa•h -1 , 13.02 kPa•h -1 and 28.26 kPa•h -1 , respectively. The
  temperature profiles were obtained at the absolute pressure of 180 kPa and the temperature
  gradients variation at axial and radial directions were analyzed. The LN 2 tank
  at fill level of 50% was pressurized to 180 kPa, 380 kPa and 580 kPa, respectively,
  with room-temperature (293 K) GHe as the pressurant gas. The influences of helium
  pressurization process and pressurization level on tank temperature profile were
  also studied. © 2018, Science Press. All right reserved.
