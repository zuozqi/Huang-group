 abstract = {Based on the computation of thermodynamic properties of binary inert gas fluids, He-Ar mixtures were used as working fluids to improve the refrigeration performance of a thermo acoustically driven pulse tube refrigerator. The experimental results indicated that the refrigeration performance with appropriate He-Ar mixtures was better than that of pure He.},
