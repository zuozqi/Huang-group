abstract: Liquefaction and solidification are two common phenomena in engineering
  fluid systems. The low temperatures of the boiling point and melting point of cryogenic
  fluids make it relatively difficult to observe the liquefaction and solidification
  processes under controlled conditions. An experimental setup for visualization of
  such processes has been designed and fabricated to capture the moments of the vapor-liquid
  and liquid-solid phase transition of nitrogen (44-80 K), argon (50-90 K) and oxygen
  (50-90 K), based on a G-M cryocooler as the cold source. The experimental results
  showed that these three cryogenic fluids behave considerably different during the
  solidification process. Â© All Right Reserved.
