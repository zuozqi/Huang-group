abstract: A novel hybrid system, comprising a parabolic trough solar collector and
  solar photovoltaic/thermal collector units, is proposed and structured for useful
  multi-generational purposes with hydrogen production. The designed system comprises
  a parabolic trough solar collector for electricity generation, hydrogen production,
  and cooling applications. The solar photovoltaic/thermal collector modules serve
  the purposes of hydrogen production and space heating. A thermodynamic analysis
  was conducted for practical applications and implementation. The overall energy
  and exergy efficiencies of the system were calculated to be 12.90% and 54.72%, respectively,
  for a solar fluid exit temperature of 477 K. The hydrogen production could reach
  up to 8.226 g/s from the parabolic trough solar collector electrolyzer and 0.07518
  g/s from the solar photovoltaic/thermal collector electrolyzer, which could be used
  for various useful domestic, medical, and industrial applications. The effects of
  varying the solar fluid exit temperature, incident solar irradiation, ambient temperature,
  and working fluids on the working system capability were examined. The proposed
  system demonstrated that the standalone solar hybrid system could serve as a vital
  tool for essential energy output purposes that are physically practical and economically
  viable. Â© 2020 Elsevier Ltd
