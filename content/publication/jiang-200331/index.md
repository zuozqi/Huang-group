abstract: At low temperature the properties of the isotope He-3 differ considerably
  from those of He-4 because of quantum effects. Based on the work of Gibbons, the
  thermodynamic properties can be calculated with a modified Strobridge equation between
  4 K and 20 K, while between 20 K and 100 K a correlation based on the modified quantum
  version of the principle of corresponding states instead. In this correlation the
  reduced de Broglie wavelength Î» is introduced as the third parameter besides the
  reduced temperature and volume. Hereby, a program is built to compute the properties
  of He-3 between 1 K and 100 K, including the PVT properties, entropy, enthalpy,
  internal energy, thermal conductivity and viscosity. The results agree with the
  technical report AFML-TR-67-175 of Air Products and Chemical Inc.
