 abstract = {A Ø2 m×2.2 m high-low temperature environment simulation chamber charged with helium gas was developed for testing aerospace products and their tolerance to high heating/cooling rate at extreme temperatures. The high cooling rate in the chamber was realized through a combination of forced convection and radiation heat transfer, which was significantly different from conventional thermal vacuum chambers. Using liquid nitrogen and a four-cylinder, as well as the two-stage Stirling cryogenerator as the cold sources, this paper conducted experimental study to test the results such as the achievable lower limit temperature and the cooling rates for approaching certain target temperatures. The Stirling cryogenerator enables the temperature of the heat sink to decrease to -210℃ when the chamber is precooled by liquid nitrogen, after which the helium gas inside is evacuated.},
