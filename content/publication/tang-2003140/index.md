abstract: Resonance frequency of the thermoacoustic prime mover plays an important
  role in the thermoacoustically driven pulse tube refrigerator. The influences of
  structure parameters and working fluids on resonance frequency are discussed. With
  standing wave thermoacoustic engine as an example, corresponding computed results
  are given.
