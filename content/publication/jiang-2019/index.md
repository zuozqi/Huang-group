abstract: In the long run, storage of cryogenic propellants on orbit is one of the
  most crucial technologies for future space exploration. Vapor cooled shield (VCS)
  has been considered as an effective tool to intercept heat leakage from the environment
  into the cryogenic tanks. In addition to that, reduce or even eliminate propellant
  boil-off. This scrutiny ascertains a 3D model to investigate the temperature distribution
  on VCS, and also conforms to the fact of temperature uniformity assumption in literature.
  The relationship amid the temperature distribution on VCS, the shield wall thickness,
  and the vented vapor's mass flow rate is analyzed for series-type VCS and parallel-type
  VCS to clarify the existing temperature gradient on VCS and the way it influences
  the MLI's insulation performance. The outcomes of the study could act as a beneficial
  tool for the thermal design of cryogenic VCS. Copyright Â© 2019 ASME
