 abstract = {Frequency matching is of great importance to a thermoacoustically driven pulse tube refrigeration system. To compute the resonance frequency of thermoacoustic engines, the fluid impedance method is introduced. The calculations of the thermoacoustic engines with different arrangements of buffer have been carried out. The influence of the buffer arrangements and the volume on the resonance frequency as well as the acoustic power of thermoacoustic engines is also discussed. Â© 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
