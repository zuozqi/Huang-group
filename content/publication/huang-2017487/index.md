abstract: A combination of polyurethane foam and multilayer insulation is adaptive
  and qualified for cryogenic propellant storage application, both on orbit for long-duration
  mission and on earth before and during launching. A generalized layer by layer model
  has been proposed to predict the thermal performance of the “Foam - Variable Density
  Multilayer Insulation combination” (FMLI) at different vacuum levels. A cryogen
  boil-off calorimeter system was designed and fabricated to measure the temperature
  profile and the apparent thermal conductivity of FMLI samples over a wide range
  of vacuum level (10−3- 105 Pa). The experimental data verified the validity of the
  model and indicated that the heat fluxes through the FMLI and the single VDMLI almost
  made no difference in vacuum of 10−3 Pa, which were both equal to 0.23 W·m−2with
  the boundary temperatures of 77 and 293 K, respectively. However, at the atmosphere
  level of 105 Pa, the heat fluxes through the FMLI and the single VDMLI significantly
  differed from each other and exacerbated to 45.2 and 147.8 W·m−2, respectively.
  In addition, a comparison between FMLI and Aerogel-MLI was also conducted for the
  same thickness and weight of VDMLI and at the same boundary temperatures and vacuum
  levels. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd
