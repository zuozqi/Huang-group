abstract: Long-term storage of cryogenic propellants on orbit as the replenishing
  fuel for spacecraft and energy supply source for space station is a crucial part
  of future space exploration. Thermodynamic vent system (TVS) was proposed as an
  effective technology to maintain the propellant tank pressure and reduce the mass
  loss of liquid propellant. This study presents an experimental investigation on
  the pressure control effect of a TVS installed in a 1.36 m3 liquid nitrogen (LN2)
  tank of the testing facility named Efficient Cryogenic Fluid Storage Test Platform
  (ECFSTP). Two operation modes, namely the mixing-only mode and the mixing-venting
  mode of TVS were compared and analyzed. The degree of superheat of the ullage dropped
  more rapidly and significantly under the mixing-venting mode, which produces the
  cooling effect by the venting stream from the throttling valve in addition to venting
  itself. The effects of different pressure control bands on the performance of the
  TVS have also been comparatively investigated. The results confirmed the feasibility
  and effectiveness of the TVS to control the tank pressure within the range of 220–260 kPa
  for long time running, with 50% fill level and 9.31 W m−2 leaking heat flux. © 2017
