abstract: The free-piston Stirling machine has been used as either thermal engine,
  cryocooler, or heat pump, due to its compact structure, high efficiency, and reliability.
  A compact engine-refrigerator dual-functional coaxial free-piston Stirling engine
  was designed and fabricated. It could output 1000 W electricity power with a conversation
  rate of 20%, when the hot end was heated up to 530°C and the cold end cooled by
  water which was heated from room temperature to 65°C. The engine was reversely operated
  as a refrigerator without any modification, and its cooling performance was measured
  at different input power. The results indicate that, a none-load cooling temperature
  142.4 K was obtained at a maximum power supply voltage of 300 VAC (50 Hz), and 193.1 K
  was reached at a minimum input power of 60 VAC (50 Hz). For a nominal power supply
  220 VAC@50 Hz (i.e., 716.8 W), the cooling power increases from 2.4 to 276 W when
  the temperature at the cold head changes from 156.6 to 203 K. The relative Carnot
  coefficient of performance of the Stirling unit as a cooler is 18.6% at 203 K. Copyright
