 abstract = {At low temperature the properties of the isotope He-3 differ considerably from those of He-4 because of quantum effects. Based on the work of Gibbons, the thermodynamic properties can be calculated with a modified Strobridge equation between 4 K and 20 K, while between 20 K and 100 K a correlation based on the modified quantum version of the principle of corresponding states instead. In this correlation the reduced de Broglie wavelength Î» is introduced as the third parameter besides the reduced temperature and volume. Hereby, a program is built to compute the properties of He-3 between 1 K and 100 K, including the PVT properties, entropy, enthalpy, internal energy, thermal conductivity and viscosity. The results agree with the technical report AFML-TR-67-175 of Air Products and Chemical Inc.},
