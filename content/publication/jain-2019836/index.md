abstract: Freezing of water flowing through a small channel can be used as a nonintrusive
  flow control mechanism for microfluidic devices. However, such ice valves have longer
  response times compared to conventional microvalves. To control and reduce the response
  time, it is crucial to understand the factors that affect the flow freezing process
  inside the channel. This study investigates freezing in pressure-driven water flow
  through a glass channel of 500 μm inner diameter using measurements of external
  channel wall temperature and flow rate synchronized with high-speed visualization.
  The effect of flow rate on the freezing process is investigated in terms of the
  external wall temperature, the growth duration of different ice modes, and the channel
  closing time. Freezing initiates as a thin layer of ice dendrites that grows along
  the inner wall and partially blocks the channel, followed by the formation and inward
  growth of a solid annular ice layer that leads to complete flow blockage and ultimate
  channel closure. A simplified analytical model is developed to determine the factors
  that govern the annular ice growth, and hence the channel closing time. For a given
  channel, the model predicts that the annular ice growth is driven purely by conduction
  due to the temperature difference between the outer channel wall and the equilibrium
  ice-water interface. The flow rate affects the initial temperature difference, and
  thereby has an indirect effect on the annular ice growth. Higher flow rates require
  a lower wall temperature to initiate ice nucleation and result in faster annular
  ice growth (and shorter closing times) than at lower flow rates. This study provides
  new insights into the freezing process in small channels and identifies the key
  factors governing the channel closing time at these small length scales commonly
  encountered in microfluidic ice valve applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd
