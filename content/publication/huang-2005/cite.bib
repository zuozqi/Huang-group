 abstract = {Nonsegmented equations for melting pressure and density at temperatures from 0.001Kto30K have been developed to fit the reference data. The maximum and average deviations between the melting pressure equation and the totaling 298 reference data are 2.17% and 0.218%, respectively. For the density equations, the average deviations are 0.236% for the liquid side and 0.218% for the solid side. Both the melting pressure curve and melting density curves predicted by the submitted equations approach their minimums at about 0.315K. Â© 2005 The American Physical Society.},
