 abstract = {In the long run, storage of cryogenic propellants on orbit is one of the most crucial technologies for future space exploration. Vapor cooled shield (VCS) has been considered as an effective tool to intercept heat leakage from the environment into the cryogenic tanks. In addition to that, reduce or even eliminate propellant boil-off. This scrutiny ascertains a 3D model to investigate the temperature distribution on VCS, and also conforms to the fact of temperature uniformity assumption in literature. The relationship amid the temperature distribution on VCS, the shield wall thickness, and the vented vapor's mass flow rate is analyzed for series-type VCS and parallel-type VCS to clarify the existing temperature gradient on VCS and the way it influences the MLI's insulation performance. The outcomes of the study could act as a beneficial tool for the thermal design of cryogenic VCS. Copyright Â© 2019 ASME},
