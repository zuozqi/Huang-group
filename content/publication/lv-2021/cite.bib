 abstract = {The primary challenge for the long-term storage of cryogens in space is evaporation and consequent pressurization due to heat leakage. This study innovatively presents the scale effects on pressurization covering a wide range of tank volume from 6.37×10-3 to 208 m3, under normal gravity and microgravity. A computational fluid dynamic model based on the volume-of-fluid method is constructed to predict the thermodynamic behaviors in partially filled hydrogen tanks. The geometric scale is found to play a significant role in influencing the pressurization rate only for tanks in the small-scale range, especially under normal gravity. The pressurization rate is lower under microgravity than under normal gravity for small tanks. However, the opposite is observed when the tank size exceeds a critical value. An empirical correlation is originally presented to relate the real pressurization rate to the tank diameter and the pressurization rate based on homogeneous model. According to a thermodynamic analysis, the direct sensible energy input of vapor, the mass transfer on the liquid-vapor interface, and the liquid thermal expansion are the three causes of self-pressurization, which are all related to the geometric scale. The conclusions can be used for the pressurization prediction of various emissions in the aerospace applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},
