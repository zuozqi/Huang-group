 abstract = {Measurements on thermal conductivity of fluid helium-3 in the literature are abundant in the liquid phase, while almost no data are available in the gas phase except some at pressures not higher than 0.1 MPa. A quantum version of the principle of corresponding states is used to predict the thermal conductivity of gaseous helium-3 by using those of helium-4, hydrogen, neon and argon. An empirical equation is developed for the thermal conductivity of both the liquid and gas phases at temperatures from 3 mK to 300 K and pressures up to 20 MPa. Similar to other cryogenic fluids like nitrogen, a sharp peak of the thermal conductivity curve is observed at low pressures. Â© 2012 American Institute of Physics.},
