abstract: A self-built computer program for the properties of He-3 between the temperature
  1 K and 100 K, the pressure up to 10 MPa is introduced. Arbitrarily selecting two
  property parameters among pressure, temperature, specific volume (or density), entropy,
  enthalpy and internal energy as the input variables, the rest, the thermal conductivity
  and viscosity could be calculated. The comprehensive unit system of the input and
  output parameters, the continuity of calculating and the high accuracy with the
  maximum error within 5â€° characterized this program as a feasible one.
