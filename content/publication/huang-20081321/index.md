abstract: As a standard property of helium-3, the surface tension is not only an important
  aspect to study the normal characteristics of this special cryogenic fluid, but
  also helpful to understand the Fermi quantum effects at low temperatures. After
  completion of studies on the thermodynamic and two typical transport properties
  (thermal conductivity and viscosity) of helium-3, all of the published experimental
  data of the surface tension of 3He have been collected. Different measurement techniques
  are compared and analyzed. The peculiar behavior of 3He surface tension, perhaps
  dominated by Fermi-Dirac quantum statistics, is analyzed and discussed at temperatures
  starting from zero to its critical point (3.3157 K). Based on a regular theoretical
  model for surface tension, a semi-empirical correlation is proposed for 3He covering
  the whole temperature range. The surface tension extrapolated to zero temperature
  by this equation is 1.5579×10 -4 N • m -1. In the vicinity of the critical point,
  the equation could be smoothly switched to the known scaling law, which takes the
  critical index 1.289. Comparison for the surface-tension behavior is performed between
  3He and its isotope 4He, which obeys Bose-Einstein statistics. © 2008 Springer Science+Business
