abstract: The computation with heat transfer, fluid flow and thermodynamics indicates
  that higher pulse tube refrigeration performance can be achieved with He-H 2 mixtures
  as working fluids than that with pure He in the cooling temperature region of 30
  K. In addition, it is found that Er3Ni, a regenerative material, is able to absorb
  H2 and forms Er 3NiHx. The hydrogen absorption capacity of Er 3Ni is about 3.5 H/Er3Ni
  in the H2 pressure region of 0.1-2.0 MPa at 30°C. The calculation shows that the
  regenerative performance of Er3NiH3.5 is better than that of Er 3Ni due to its higher
  volume specific heat. Experimental results show that the pulse tube refrigeration
  performance in 30 K cooling temperature region is obviously enhanced with He-H2
  mixtures and Er 3NiHx regenerative material. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
