 abstract = {The performance of pulse tube refrigerator (PTR) can be improved by using mixtures as its working fluid. Based on an experimental work on a two-stage PTR with He-H2 mixture whose hydrogen percentage rising from 0% to 100%, an optimal proportion of H2 in the He-H2 mixture for the cooling temperature around 30K was found. At this temperature region, the cooling power and COP of the PTR reach their maximum both with an increment about 30-40% against pure helium when the hydrogen percent is about 60-70%.
