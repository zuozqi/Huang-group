 abstract = {A framework of the state equation for cryogenic fluid 3He is constructed. Temperature and density are treated as the independent input variables and Helmholtz energy is used as the dependent variable. All other thermodynamic property expressions are derived from Helmholtz energy with respect to temperature or density or both of them. The form of the state equation and the derived property expressions together show the thermodynamic consistency, feasibility and advantages of the framework.},
