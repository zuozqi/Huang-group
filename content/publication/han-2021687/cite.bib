 abstract = {Research question: Is vitrification with microinjection of single seminiferous tubules an efficient cryopreservation approach for limited testicular tissue? Design: Testicular tissue from 10 patients with normal spermatogenesis were assigned to a fresh control group or one of the following cryopreservation procedures: uncontrolled slow freezing (USF) using either 1.5 or 2.1 M DMSO combined with sucrose and vitrification with or without single seminiferous tubules microinjection. Results: Single seminiferous tubules microinjected with cryoprotective agents (CPA) enhanced the penetration of CPA compared with CPA-treated testicular tissue fragments. Microinjection of seminiferous tubules (VLP) maintained tubule structural integrity and germ cell numbers, and reduced spermatogonial apoptosis after cryopreservation compared with vitrification without microinjection (apoptosis rate: VLP versus vitrification without microinjection, P = 0.047; VLP versus USF, P= 0.049). Freezing of single seminiferous tubules using 0.25-ml straws and traditional sperm freezing methods protected sperm retrieval and recovery rates, and the progressive motility index. Conclusions: Vitrification of single seminiferous tubule with microinjection of low CPA concentration is an effective approach to testicular cryopreservation. Â© 2021},
