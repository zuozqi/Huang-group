abstract: Based on the ideal gas state equation and the saturated vapor pressure equation
  of helium-3, a saturated vapor density equation is proposed, which can be applied
  for calculating the saturated vapor density of helium-3 from 0.01 K to the critical
  temperature. Above 1.4 K, the average deviation between the results by this equation
  and experimental data is about 0.66% and the maximum is 2%. Below 1.4 K, the results
  of this work show a comfortable agreement with those by virial state equation (the
  deviations are generally within 0.1%). Based on this new vapor density equation,
  the compressibility factor of saturated vapor is determined and the vaporization
  heat is calculated. Â© 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
