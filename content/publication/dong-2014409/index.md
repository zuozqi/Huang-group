abstract: Static electricity can be generated at the interface between a fluid and
  a solid surface. Hydrocarbon products as well as liquid hydrogen in chemical and
  energy industry are of low conductivity, inflammable and explosive, which enables
  the static charge easily accumulated, resulting in high electric potentials and
  electric fields during its transportation and storage. To avoid safety hazard due
  to sparks of sufficient energy for an explosion to occur inside a tank, this paper
  studied the formation and distribution of electrical potential of some typical hydrocarbon
  products and liquid hydrogen in cylindrical vessels. Poisson equation and Laplace
  equation were solved by using Bessel function to get the potential value distribution
  of liquid and gas in the tanks. The impact parameters such as tank structure, fluid
  properties and charge density to the potential were analyzed. The potential variation
  behavior against the above parameters was obtained. It was found that the maximum
  static potential appears at about 72% of the liquid level/height from the bottom
  instead of the liquid-gas interface. The calculations also showed that the potential
  reaches its crest value for each fluid studied when the filling rate is 65%-75%
  of the full capacity. Some suggestions were given for design of low conductivity
  fluid tanks to avoid high electric potential safety hazard. Â© All Rights Reserved.
