abstract: Researches on the impact of baffles on sloshing suppression of two-phase
  fluids in storage tanks have been widely conducted in literature, particularly at
  normal gravity. However, few studies focused on the effect of the baffles on self-pressurization
  and thermal stratification of the fluids in containers. This paper uses Volume of
  Fluid (VOF) method to simulate thermal behavior of cryogenics in tanks with different
  baffle structures in microgravity environment. Groups of gravity levels, fill levels
  and baffle configurations (distances, angles and gaps) are investigated. Up to 54%
  reduction in pressurization rate was observed by optimizing the baffle settings,
  which is an attractive improvement for missions of long term storage of cryogen
  on orbit. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd
