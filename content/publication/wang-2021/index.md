abstract: The study of pressure flow through wire screens has attracted considerable
  attention as these screens are employed in various engineering applications. This
  paper presents an analytical model for a flow-through-screen (FTS) friction factor
  considering the effects of the pore structures. The pressure drop is quantified
  using an integrated form of the Forchheimer equation, where permeability is expressed
  as a function of screen parameters, including pore diameter, tortuosity, constriction
  factor, and porosity. Each parameter is determined solely from the pore-scale morphology
  of various weaves, and hence, the accurate expression for each screen is derived
  without introducing additional fitting constants. The results obtained using the
  proposed model are corroborated by 1500 + data points from existing literature with
  a mean absolute relative error of 23.0%, focusing on four types of typical wire
  screens—Plain Square, Twilled Square, Plain Dutch, and Dutch Twill—and both room-temperature
  and cryogenic fluids in the Reynolds number range of 0.1<Re<1000. © 2020 Elsevier
