abstract: An equation of state for normal liquid 3He has been constructed in the form
  of Helmholtz free energy as a function of independent parameters - temperature,
  and density. The equation was fitted simultaneously to the collected experimental
  p-ρ-T, specific heat, sound velocity, isobaric expansion coefficient and isothermal
  compressibility coefficient from the world's literature to accuracies comparable
  with reasonable experimental errors in the measured quantities. Extensive comparisons
  between the equation of state and experimental data have been made by a set of deviation
  plots. The state equation is valid in the region for temperatures from 0.1 K to
  Tc = 3.3157 K, and for pressures from vapor pressures to melting pressures. © Springer
